A 3-row grid of floating terrain cards is centered on the table, with columns for open ground, difficult ground, no escape, and city (no neutral city card). Each card keeps its scene tint (terrain colors) and has readable left-to-right text listing terrain, territory, apparent troops, divisions, troops, and march type; march labels are visible on cards with friendly divisions, while the left/right arrows only appear when hovering a card. The player’s unit tokens are visible on the near edge of the home city card, and no enemy tokens are visible because apparent enemy troops are zero."
